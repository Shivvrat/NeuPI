    "# NeuPI: Self-Supervised Training of a Neural Surrogate\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the core functionality of the `neupi` library: training a neural network to solve inference tasks on a Probabilistic Models (PMs) in a **self-supervised** manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to use the negative log likelihood score of the assignment from the PM as the loss function. The neural network generates candidate solutions (variable assignments), and the PGM evaluates their quality by computing their log-likelihood. The network's goal is to learn to produce assignments that maximize this likelihood (minimize the loss), effectively solving the Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover:\n",
    "1. Loading a `MarkovNetwork` to act as the evaluator (the \"teacher\").\n",
    "2. Creating a synthetic dataset for training.\n",
    "3. Defining an `MLP` model (the \"neural solver\").\n",
    "4. Configuring the `SelfSupervisedTrainer` to manage the training process.\n",
    "5. Running the training loop and observing the decrease in loss."
