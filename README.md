# NeuPI: A Library for Neural Probabilistic Inference

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1012621004.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15873539)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Shivvrat/NeuPI/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Shivvrat/NeuPI/actions/workflows/release.yml)

NeuPI is a PyTorch-based library for solving inference tasks in Probabilistic Models (PMs) using neural network surrogates. It provides a modular framework for training neural models in a self-supervised fashion, where the Probabilistic Model itself provides the supervisory signal.

This approach eliminates the need for labeled training data, enabling neural networks to learn to solve tasks like Most Probable Explanation (MPE), Constrained MPE, and Marginal MAP by directly optimizing for the log-likelihood of their proposed solutions.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://neupi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://neupi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Shivvrat/NeuPI](https://github.com/Shivvrat/NeuPI).

## Key Features

* **Self-Supervised Training**: Train neural solvers using only the Probabilistic Model—no labeled data required.
* **Advanced Inference**: Includes the **ITSELF** (`Inference Time Self-Supervised Training`) engine for test-time refinement, significantly improving inference accuracy.
* **Modular Architecture**: A clean separation of components:
    * **PGM Evaluators** (`MarkovNetwork`, `SumProductNetwork`)
    * **Neural Solvers** (`MLP`)
    * **Input Embedders** (`DiscreteEmbedder`)
    * **Trainers** (`SelfSupervisedTrainer`)
    * **Inference Engines** (`SinglePassInferenceEngine`, `ITSELF_Engine`)
* **Extensible**: Easily register your own custom components using the built-in factory system.
* **Efficient Backend**: Utilizes a high-performance Cython backend for parsing `.uai` files.

## Core Workflow

The core idea of NeuPI is to train a neural network to act as a fast approximator for a complex PM query. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Load a PM**: The negative log-likelihood of the PM acts as the (approximate) loss and evaluates the quality of solutions.
2.  **Define a Neural Surrogate**: This is the "solver," which learns to generate high-quality solutions.
3.  **Train**: Use the `SelfSupervisedTrainer` to train the solver. The loss is the negative log-likelihood of the solver's solutions, as computed by the PM.
4.  **Infer**: Use the trained model with an `InferenceEngine` to answer new queries.
5.  **Discretize**: Use a `Discretizer` to discretize the probabilities to binary assignments.

## Installation

First, ensure you have PyTorch installed (with a GPU version if you want to use it). 

### Using PyPI

```bash
pip install neupi
```

### From Source

Then, clone the repository and install the library and its dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shivvrat/NeuPI
cd NeuPI

# Install the library in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Examples provided in the `examples` directory demonstrate:

    1.  Computing the negative log-likelihood (loss) of a solution to a MPE query on a Markov Network (Probabilistic Graphical odels) and Sum-Product Network (Probabilistic Circuits).
    2.  Training a neural solver to solve MPE queries on a Markov Network and Sum-Product Network.
    3.  Performing inference with a trained neural solver on a Markov Network and Sum-Product Network.
    4.  Discretizing the probabilities to binary assignments. Advanced discretizers include `KNearestDiscretizer` and `OAUAI`.
